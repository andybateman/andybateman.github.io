<p>We wanted some lightweight summer sleeping bags, our UK Bags are far too warm for the job, so after a bit of a search we bought a couple of these. There simple, lightly cut and light, zip together. We bought them specificy for this trip but will be ok for an English summer. Good down to +4 oC.</p>
