<p>We've left Kuala Lumpur with the worlds tallest twin towers and the worlds highest communication tower, the highest flagpole, the world best Airport with the worlds highest control tower, next to the worlds longest unsupported aircraft hanger to head for Singapore, oddly flying into the the worlds best Airport. Malaysians love boasting but some of it maybe self proclaimed. Maybe, Worlds Best Airport (in Malaysia).</p>
<p>One thing we sadly missed in KL due to a lack of interest on Becky's part was the International Telephone Museum, I'm told I can come back with Sim one day to take a trip around.</p>

<p>Singapore is a lovely contrast to KL, three times the price (about 10 instead of 4 quid a day), but cleaner, easier and safer.  We're staying next to Sultan Mosque in a little hostel called <a href="http://www.sleepysams.com/" target="_blank">Sleepy Sam's.</a> Fantastic showers and a surprisingly quiet dorm...</p>

<p>The city feels much like its been designed by an art gallery curator and is lovely to walk about, even in a thunderstorm. Since it is raining heavily. We've come inside out of the rain, in to the coolness of an internet cafe, to stick some photos up and listen to a bit of <a href="http://www.appleam.com/" target="_blank">Apple AM, Musgrove Parks very own radio station</a>. We'd also like to say hi to everyone in Fielding, thanks for showing an interest in our trip, while we're thanking people, as there aren't many more entries coming thanks everyone, just under 100 people subscribed to hear about our adventures and more visited the site, we hope we didn't bore you and hopefully enjoyed it. We'll find a few more things to write about.</p>
