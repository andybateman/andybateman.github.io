<p>Everyone needs somewhere to sleep and this is my favourite tent in the world so I donâ€™t have anything bad to say about it, granted, anyone who knows about tents knows its a little over the top for the warm breezy weather we'll be camping in, but maybe, just maybe we'll hike off into the mountains in New Zealand and I'll be glad I had it with me...</p>
<p>The Ultra Quasar is an Industry Leader, A 4/5 Season Tent that can withstand anything you can throw at it (time will tell if it can withstand Becky, my Voyager couldn't). It will fit 2 people very comfortably, we've had 5 in there for a night on Dartmoor but that was very stupid, it has 2 porches, good for storage, what more can I say.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> All of it!<br />
<strong>Cons:</strong> The price...<br />
