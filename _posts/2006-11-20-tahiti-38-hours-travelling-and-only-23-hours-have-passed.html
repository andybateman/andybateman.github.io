<p>Well hello, we're wandering about the Capital of Tahiti, Papeete, waiting to book in to our villa on the coast, sadly, we arrived at 5 this morning but can't book in until after 12.</p>
<p>Our trip here was long but enjoyable, Virgin Atlantic fed us well and provided loads of geeky entertainment, New Zealand Air just let us sleep.  We got to leave the airport at LAX too so we can add American soil to our list of places visited!</p>
<p>Hope the UK is good, Tahiti's Hot, Humid and Green. They've got the prettiest Airport in the World! We're doing very well with our French, we're even typing this on a French keyboard which is a bit of a struggle.</p>
<p>Speak to you soon when we have some photos.</p>
<p>Becky and Andy</p>
