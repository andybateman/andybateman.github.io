<p>Another trip off to a Landmark Trust property, this time Fort Clonque.<br />

<p>It's a fort built sometime around 1850 to protect England, now just protecting tourists like us from the elements.  It has been modernised since being bought by the Trust, with Electricity, heating in the form of storage heaters (although the open fire in the main room is still usable), running water and a lovely shower room.  The bedrooms accommodate 13  people in single beds, but with just eight of us we had plenty of space.</p>
<p>We all arrived at the airport at different times, collected in one of the few pubs on the Island and headed for the Fort via 'Zig Zag Path'.</p>
<p>Many days were spent exploring the island of Alderney walking all the way around, photos will follow of the rest of the island.</p>
