<p>Time for a new adventure, this time a solo adventure, just me and my bike.</p>
<p>I'm in YHA Central in London, it's so good to be back in a Hostel meeting new people, sometimes this feels more like home than home. Of course home is wherever Becky is and sadly that isn't with me tonight.</p>
<p>I'm heading off in the morning out of the Capital to the south towards Brighton, I'll then follow the coast west until catching the ferry on to the Isle of White, I'll cycle round the bottom and ferry back to the mainland, heading west again until Weymouth where I'll head back north towards home.</p>
<p>So, off I go, panniers packed ready for the morning!</p>
