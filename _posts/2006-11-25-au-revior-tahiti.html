<p>Things to know about Tahiti:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to catch a bus, give yourself a couple of hours, and don't expect one after 4pm.</li>
<li>The car of choice is a Peugoet 106 in White, everyone has one... just like me</li>
<li>Just because its 30 degrees, we're the other side of the world and Tahiti's never seen the snow, at Christmas time you can still buy a 6 foot inflatable snow man.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few photos of Tahiti, we have many more so expect a slide show when we get home.</p>
