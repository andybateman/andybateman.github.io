<p>Well Tahiti's coming to an end, very sad, its fantastic here, except maybe the buses, just as good as they are in Somerset...</p>
<p>After eventually catching a bus back to our little villa, we have been doing very little! Relaxing, (Andy has been sleeping a lot) watching the sunset over the lagoon next to our balcony! The lagoon is full of coral and amazing looking fish...we have spent quite a long time just watching them in the crystal clear water! Our host (Steve or Mano?) has been very welcoming...it seems his entire family are in on the hotelling buisness. It is so peaceful here, even though it is next to the only main road on the island you wouldn't know it! We went to our local shop (about a mile away) yesterday in the torrential rain. It was fantastic- and warm!!! Not the English drizzle but severe downpour. Twenty minutes later everthing was dry and hot again. It has been strange getting used to the heat again- last night after the sunset it was still 28oC!</p>
<p>The surrounding area is like a set out of 'Lost'- lush vegetation and palm trees....almost hear Kate shouting "Jack!!!" And just for Toni there are hundreds of 'Warriors' so get Steve to agree to come here and get the car of your dreams...... (just don't sit on the back over a speed bump.... terrible things will happen....)</p>
<p>We'd recomend any of you to come here (hire a car).</p>
<p>Andy and Bex</p>
<p style="clear: both">And who'd have thought, 28 oC and Beckys wearing a fleece... (Becky says: I was cold!!)</p>
