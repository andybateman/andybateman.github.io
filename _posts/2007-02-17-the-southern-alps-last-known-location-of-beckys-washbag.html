<p>We drove across from the Christchurch and the East coast to the West coast through the Southern Alps, with some  (OK, all of it) amazing scenery and some hairy roads we travelled to Arthurs Pass Village (Population 50, highest settlement in NZ) where we planned to stay the night, although a lovely village and a cheap little campsite we neglected to think through our accomidation.  Arthurs Pass is THE route through the mountains with the rail road one side and the main highway the other, our tent, slap in the middle.</p>
<p>In the morning, after a noisy night, and little sleep and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kitjunkie.org/albums/v/travelling/nz/southernalps/P2150330.JPG.html">catastrophic tent faliure</a> (we'd like to thank Terra Nova for making tents that just won't die. our tent was as good as new by the next night), we went off the the DOC office to find out about local walks. I wanted to do Avalanche Pass, a crazy walk, a steep 1 kilometre rise over 4 hours, but with a lot of low cloud (low cloud? or high mountains?) and bags under our eyes, we decided against it, settling for a nice 3 hour hike through the valley and then another drive down to the West Coast<br />
