<p>Tahihi, lovely place, if you came here you won't want to leave. So we're not.</p>
<p>We've booked ourselves in for another couple days into a little hotel until Saturday, then we're DEFINITELY off to Rarotonga, no excuses. So for now its more beaches, of course there are beaches there too, there are beaches everywhere we're going, but for now we like these.</p>
<p>So off to the beach we go.</p>
