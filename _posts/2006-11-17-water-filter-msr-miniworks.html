<p>We've used this filter over the past few years on Dartmoor, its proven to be very hard to break, the one time I did, I was able to take it apart and clean it, its very field maintainable.<br />
We will be taking it with us so we can provide our own safe water.<br />

Reasonably cheep per litre cost with little effort.</p>
