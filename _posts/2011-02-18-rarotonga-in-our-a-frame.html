<p>Lets start off with: we're here, we're safe, we're warm (Its 29oC today).  The island is quite quiet as we've hit a bit of a tourist low season, I'm surprised there is such a thing as the weather is still great and the beaches are lovely.</p>
<p>Our little house is a traditional A-frame on the beach, with the kitchen, bathroom and living area downstairs and large bedroom overlooking the sea upstairs.  We do have a TV, it's got one channel provided by the church, I watched 5 minutes of 'Jesus, where is he now?' over breakfast.</p>

<p>I've booked some SCUBA diving, tomorrow I'm going back to the site of my first ever dive and have a two tanker on Sunday, beats diving for shopping trolleys in Plymouth.</p>
<p>We've hired a scooter, to get about on. I love the backwards-ness here, let me tell you the process I went through to get it:</p>
<p>  1. Hire a scooter<br />
  2. Drive scooter on road to police station<br />
  3. Apply and complete driving license to be able to drive scooter on road.</p>
<p>We took it for a spin around the island, this took about an hour after riding through a storm, getting absolutely drenched and still having time to dry off before arriving back home.</p>
<p>Well that's all for now! In summary, we haven't actually done much.</p>
<p>All of which is good.</p>
