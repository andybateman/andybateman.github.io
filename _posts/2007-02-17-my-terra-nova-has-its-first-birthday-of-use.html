<p>Thats 365 (ish) nights of use! Bought in 2000.  Its first birthday was spent on a beach during a kayaking tour of Abel Tasman National Park.</p>
<p>Its been up mountains, sat on wind blown scenery, dug in on beaches during wintry offshore winds, crammed with too many people during near death experiences (thats 5! you try it), and just had a fab time during the calm of family camp sites.</p>
<p>Its been sewn, patched, resealed, re-elasticized, cleaned by many immigration departments, poles broken and fixed.  But other than maintenance due to excessive use (and Becky)... still going strong.</p>
<p>So thank you Terra Nova for sheltering us from the elements, here is to another year!<br />
