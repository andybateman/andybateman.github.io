<p>The last thing I did before we left was went clothes shopping, never too keen to spend money, these shirts were 45quid each and took some convincing to buy them, but i'm already glad I did.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>I bought 2, one short sleeved, and one long sleeved (with buttons so you can role them into short sleeves). They're full of innovation, secret pockets, little clips so you don't need pegs (excilent idea).<br />
They can be washed, dried and worn again in hours, will update this post at the end of the trip to tell you if they lasted, if they do, they are so worth 50 quid.</p>
