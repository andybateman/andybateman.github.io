<p>We should have done this earlier, but with the unpacking, washing and backpacker blues, time has slipped away from us, we've been back for a week or so now, started settling back into work and catch up with friends.</p>
<p>Lots of people have asked us our favourite places so here's a few:</p>
<p>Romance and Worry Free Relaxing: Maya island in Fiji<br />
Shopping and Culture: Singapore<br />
Scuba Diving and Idyllic Beaches: Rarotonga in the Cook Islands<br />
Cheap Living (and most probable place to get food poisoning): KL in Malaysia<br />
Most expensive: Tahiti<br />
Extreme Sports, Kayaking, Climbing, Fantastic Scenery, collecting injuries: Quite Obviously, New Zealand<br />
Place we'd like to explore further: Sydney and Australia (and eat those Manly fish and chips!)</p>
<p>If I really had to pick one place from the whole trip to call my favourite? Abel Tasman National Park, sitting in my Kayak with Bex and Zoe singing <a href="http://www.thatguitarman.com/MP3/tom_cruise_scares_me.mp3" target="_blank">'Tom Cruise Scares Me'</a> to the seals.</p>
<p>We hope to keep in touch with new friends and you're welcome to come and visit!</p>
<p>Well back to the chilly uk weather that is summer.</p>
