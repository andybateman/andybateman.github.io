<p>A simple waterproof sack that we've used to put our important items in, keeping it dry while kayak touring and hiking. What can we say, very durable and has been submerged too many times. Invaluable. While you're at it, have a listen to this: <a href="http://www.themesfromtv.com/l/552">TV Themes here</a></p>
