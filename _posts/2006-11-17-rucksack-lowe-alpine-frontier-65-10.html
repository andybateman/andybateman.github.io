<p>I've had this bag for many years, Its done me well, duarble (its got a small hole but the gaffa tapes holding), great back system.<br />
Its done well for all its uses, dartmoor, the alps, treking, moving house, the list goes on and on, and so does the bag, got to be coming up to its 10th birthday...<br />

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Durable, Floating Lid so you can fit more in<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: A little on the heavy side when empty</p>
